# The Grimm Troupe

> Shadows dream of endless fire,
> Flames devour and embers swoop,
> One will light the Nightmare Lantern,
> Call and serve in Grimm's dread Troupe.

The Grimm Troupe are a joyous group of travelling performer bugs of various species. Their colour theme is red, and they all wear white masks with vertical splits crossing their eyes.[1] The known members are Grimm, the Troupe Master, Brumm, the accordion player, and Divine, as well as a couple of Grimmsteeds.
