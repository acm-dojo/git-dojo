# The Mantis Tribe

> They retain their intellect and their honour, though also their lethal traditions.

The Mantis Tribe is a tribe of proud and ferocious bugs whose traditions date back to ancient times before the kingdom of Hallownest was founded.[1][2] These naturally-born fighters built the Mantis Village deep within the Fungal Wastes.[3] Led by the Mantis Lords,[4] they defend their territories from intruders with their lives.[5] Their flying youths are compelled to prove their strength before becoming warriors.[6] However, they all come to respect any who would defeat their leaders in honourable combat, and give them the freedom to enter their territory.[7]
