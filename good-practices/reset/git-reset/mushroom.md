# The Mushroom Clan

> Strength in the shared self.
> Strength in the mind united.

The Mushroom Clan is made up of a species of sentient mushroom-like beings, neither bugs nor plants.[1][2] They took residence in the Fungal Wastes bordering both the City of Tears and Deepnest, where they hide among the scenery.

These territorial creatures possess a hive mind and developed their own language.[1][3] The Lore Tablets they leave can be translated by wearing the Spore Shroom Charm.
