# The Mosskin Tribe

> The Green Children walked from the dream unto these lands.

The Mosskin are a tribe of plant-like bugs, living in Greenpath and the Moss Chapel in Queen's Gardens.[1][2]

They let the Pale King build roads throughout their lush caves, but warned that anything straying from them would be subject to their laws.[3] They also chose to stay away from the Queen's Gardens, once an extension of their territory, claimed by the White Lady.[4] Unlike the Moth Tribe, however, they kept their faith.[5]
